# headermenu
This is a shrinking header that contains three links in the header to external pages (the first link containing a drop down menu)

Below the header are internal links for single page layout. On scroll, the internal links are hidden, the menu srinks, and a button appears on the left margin. The button hides and shows the internal links on the single page.
